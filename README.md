# React Projects Practise

I originally created this site to learn React and Javascript.

It slowly been turning into a portfolio and I need to change the url one day.

You'll find a few projects in the top left by clicking on the tabs.

The projects aren't perfect, they're more proof of concepts.

Check them out here: https://xavierpurcell.github.io/ReactProjects/

I'll randomly do updates sometimes to fix mistakes!
